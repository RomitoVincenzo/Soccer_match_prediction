# Soccer match prediction PySpak Big Data Project
Football is a sport that is very present in people lifeâ€™s, people use to watch, play, and also BET.<br>
But is it actually possible to do better that the bookmakers?<br>
We performed some EDA and create our own ML models thanks to PySpark pipelines and confronted them with the Bookies models!<br>
For more insights and to observe the results, you can consult both the notebook and the .ppt presentation.<br>
Enjoy!
